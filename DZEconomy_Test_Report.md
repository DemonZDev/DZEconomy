## 2. Configuration File Analysis

### 📋 config.yml - Status: ✅ VALID (Simplified)

**Verified Elements:**
- ✅ Database settings present (MySQL support, disabled by default)
- ✅ Starting balances: Money=50000, MobCoin=500, Gem=5 (matches README)
- ✅ Conversion rates correct: 1 Gem = 100 MobCoin = 10,000 Money
- ✅ Request timeout: 120 seconds
- ✅ PvP transfer enabled

**Discrepancies from README:**
- ⚠️ No `debug` field
- ⚠️ No `auto-save-interval` field
- ⚠️ No `format.use-short-form` or `decimal-limit` fields
- ⚠️ No `hooks.placeholderapi` or `hooks.luckperms` fields
- ⚠️ No currency symbols ($, ⛂, ♦) defined
- ⚠️ No decimal-places settings per currency

**Assessment:** The config is functional but simplified compared to README specification.

---

### 📋 ranks.yml - Status: ⚠️ VALID (Major Structural Differences)

**Verified Elements:**
- ✅ Default rank: tax=5%, cooldown=300s, max_daily_sends=5, boss_bonus=0%
- ✅ Example rank: tax=2%, cooldown=150s, max_daily_sends=10, boss_bonus=5%
- ✅ VIP rank present (not in README)

**MAJOR DISCREPANCIES from README:**
- ❌ README shows nested structure per currency (money:{}, mobcoin:{}, gem:{})
- ❌ README shows enable flags for each feature
- ❌ README shows separate tax settings per currency
- ❌ README shows min-send-limit and max-send-limit per currency
- ❌ README shows times-send-limit with duration
- ❌ Actual implementation has flat structure without currency-specific settings

**README Expected Structure:**
```yaml
default:
  money: { enable:true }
    tax: { enable: true, percentage: 5.0 }
    send-cooldown: { enable: true, duration: 300s }
    send-limit: { enable: true, amount: 5000.0, duration: daily }
    max-send-limit: { enable: true, amount: 1000.0, duration: daily }
    min-send-limit: { enable: true, amount: 100.0, duration: daily }
```

**Actual Generated Structure:**
```yaml
default:
  tax: 5.0
  cooldown: 300
  max_daily_sends: 5
```

**Critical Finding:** The implementation does NOT match the detailed README specification. Either:
1. The README is outdated
2. The implementation is simplified
3. This is a different version than documented

2. **Fix Confirmed Defect**
   - Replace ${version} placeholder with actual version (1.0.0)
   - Location: plugin.yml or build configuration
   
3. **Clarify Documentation Alignment**
   - Determine if README or implementation represents intended behavior
   - For each discrepancy, decide: update docs OR update code
   - Priority items:
     - ranks.yml structure (nested vs. flat)
     - mob-rewards.yml categories (which mobs belong where)
     - config.yml missing fields (intended or docs outdated)

### 🟡 Medium Priority
4. **Install Missing Dependencies**
   - Obtain LuckPerms-Bukkit-5.5.0.jar
   - Obtain PlaceholderAPI-2.11.6.jar

## 10. Conclusion

### Summary
DZEconomy (version unresolved in build) successfully loads on PaperMC 1.21.1 with Java 21 and generates all required configuration files without errors. However, **NO gameplay features were tested** due to environment limitations (no Minecraft client, dependencies unavailable).

### Key Findings
✅ **Confirmed Working:** Server integration, plugin loading, config generation, console error-free  
⚠️ **Documentation Mismatches:** Significant differences between README and actual configs (unverified if bugs)  
🔴 **Confirmed Defect:** Version placeholder not substituted (${version} instead of 1.0.0)  
❌ **Completely Untested:** All user-facing features (commands, economy, PvP, mob rewards)

### Test Verdict
**STATUS:** ⚠️ INCONCLUSIVE - REQUIRES GAMEPLAY TESTING

The plugin *appears* functional based on successful loading and proper file generation, but without gameplay testing, we cannot confirm:
- Whether commands work
- Whether economy calculations are correct  
- Whether config discrepancies are bugs or documentation errors  

**Critical Next Step:** Live gameplay testing is mandatory to:
1. Verify all commands function correctly
2. Distinguish documentation errors from functional bugs
3. Test currency calculations, taxes, and cooldowns
4. Validate PvP and mob reward mechanics
